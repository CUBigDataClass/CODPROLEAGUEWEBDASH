Trip Planner is the web based application that allows users to plan their trip according to their destination.
All you have to do is enter the desired location into the search bar and we will take care of the rest.
Trip Planner is connected to multiple APIs to help us provide you with the best information.
You enter the destination and we will provide with the cheapest flight tickets, a weather report, and things to do.
